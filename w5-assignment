You are the CIO of a pharmaceutical company and the CCO (Chief Commercial Officer) of the company wants to launch a new e-commerce platform as soon as possible.
State three persons whose presence to the kick-off meeting of the project would be useful. What key point will you absolutely need to discuss with each of these persons for this project to succeed?

The initial kickoff meeting should include the stakeholders who are responsible and accountable to initiate, build and deliver the project. As a CIO, I would ask Manager, Technical Leader and Project Manager to join the meeting. Below are their corresponding key point contributions to accomplish a project.

1: Manager
Manager is the person who provides economics aspects of IT and responsible to build and run IT projects efficiently.

2: Technical Leader
Technical leader builds application & technical landscape and responsible for security, architecture and technology.

3: Project Manager
Project manager would be required to build and maintain a right balance of employees to accomplish project.
