	2-Boundaries
	3-Controlling
	4-Hierarchy
1-De/centralization
Matrix of X[Business process standardization], Y[Business Process Integration (sharing of information)]
[X,Y]
Low, Low  => Diversification (ex. food chain. no information sharing required
Low, High => Coordination
High,High => Unification (ex. Investment Bank, treat every global customer in similar manner) 
High, Low => Replication
2-Boundaries (where sould I get the IT organization)
-should we have many IT people in business or many business people in IT?
3-Controlling
