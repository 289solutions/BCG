1: The architecture to manage tension ahead of time Manage the client's expectation Product & Service Offer The catalogue to overcome tension about products Showcase even on small stuff Auguste Detoeuf - Never complaint about a difficult client: He makes you progress. Treat others even better: They are the person why you make profits.

2: Manage tensions (inevitable scenarios of delay, breach etc) -Involve all stakeholders ahead of time around same table -Define an architecture (IT policy of application(s/w), data(security,storage),infrastructure(service level, types of material)

3: Manage client's expectation -Segmentation -Client's settisfaction = Perception - Expectation -Expectation of 3 types: -Basic (things should work) -Waiting Time -Personalization (People don't want to be treated as number but as individual) -Perception of 3 component -Product offering -Operation -Behavior

4: Product & Service Offer -Product and service offer must be consistent with policy

5: The catalogue to overcome tension about products Aim of Catalogue -Present a consistent product offer -Remind constraints and desadvantages -Explain policies Creating catalogue -Tradeoff between IT preference and price

6: Showcase even on small stuff [how to manage trouble] -Set the expectation by stating what service is being provided and how will it be improving. -Continuous improvement culture

7: Key takeaways

Define clear norms and standards
Product and service offer must be well explained, simple and credible
Make products cheap/costly which product you want people to use/don't use
Very carefull about small stuff (providing service, managing expectation, ensure service is working smoothly)

1:Introduction -3 factories of IT department -what is an efficient factory -Two Speed IT -Project management -Manage the infrastructure

2:-3 factories of IT department Application odevelopment, Infrastructure (make sure good QOS at low cost), User support

3:-what is an efficient factory Maximum value at minimal cost Cost = f(demand quality, Unit productivity, technical complexity) Demand quality: its about defining right process between business & IT. Unit productivity: Right project methodology (manage resource cost) Technical Complexity Maximize IT performance = minimize cost / vc* = min[(Demand quality)^-1 * (Unit productivity)^-1 * (Technical complexity)]

Demand quality = #Requirements/vc* Unit productivity = #Resources per Output * Cost per resource Technical complexity = #output units / requirements

-> value created
4:-Two Speed IT Industrial speed: Predictability, long lead teams, functionally organized teams Digital speed: Unpredictability, speed, flexibility, collaboration -Differentiate the requirements to be processed at either industrial speed or digital speed -Create platform for architecture then put applications for global requirement adaption

5:-Project management Optimize 3 things: Business requirements & quality, Delay, and cost Key focus: Time Must have and nice to have in requirements Train model (train going in tunnel) 6 simple rules for project management: -1-Limit the definition phase -2-Finish each project in 12 months -3-Limit project's size -4-Set tangible intermidiate milestones -5-Prioritize functionalities -6-Establish formal reviews (where business people understand exactly the situation and dificulties of project. There must be transparancy in project)

technological aspect, Business aspect & leader aspect

6:-Manage the infrastructure Infrastructure represents 50-60% of the cost of total IT budget. -Consider technical constraints -Risght skillset of employees -Right process at right place and respect it

the role of CIOs -Gurantee the reliability of operations on daily basis (incidents) -Continuously transform infrastructure to make sure its more reliable and cost efficient -Formalize a specific infrastructure strategic plan with standable milestones, specific dates.

Decision on outsource: 1:Rely on strategic plan(what you want to achieve); 2:Win-Win situation; 3:define outsourcing expectation and internal expectation

Building an IT Organization
How to think about an IT organization
A right workforce composition is must
Strategic workforce management
outsourcing & Offshoing strategies
Use sociology to build a real life organization

2:Building an IT Organization
-Centralized/decentralized
	Centralized: If have to reduce cost dramatically
	Decentralized: More agile, more adaptive, get much closer to business
-Organized by technologies/businesses
-Team for taking decisions on different matters(economics, architecture & technology, security, project portfolio)
-Right project management methodology (need one methodology or more than one)
-Make people engage, lead, take risks, do their job and on their job [Organization enablers] [Know role mandates and accountability of each other]
-Right KPIs alligned with our strategy
-Right reward mechanism

3:
-IT organization must alligne with the business strategy
-IT Oganization piller:
	1-De/centralization
	2-Boundaries
	3-Controlling
	4-Hierarchy
1-De/centralization
Matrix of X[Business process standardization], Y[Business Process Integration (sharing of information)]
[X,Y]
Low, Low  => Diversification (ex. food chain. no information sharing required
Low, High => Coordination
High,High => Unification (ex. Investment Bank, treat every global customer in similar manner) 
High, Low => Replication
2-Boundaries (where sould I get the IT organization)
-should we have many IT people in business or many business people in IT?
3-Controlling
	-Money
	-Application Landscape
	-Technical landscape
	-Project planning (how many projects, when will you start, delievery date)
	-People control tower
	-Sourcing (supply chain)
4-Hierarchy
	-Project manager
	-Technical leader
	-Manager

4:A Right Workforce Composition Is a Must
CIO challanges:
	The capacity to grow internally
	The need for flexibility in peak and off-peak situation
	Obtain best quality-price ratio for each resources
What activities to keep in house?
	-strategic
	-want to keep the knowledge
	-If we keep develop staff internal, we would be able to develop some strategic advantage for business
What to keep onshore/off-shore?
	-What can be done locally/remot?
What to outsource?
	-Organization want to keep mastery of system to them selves

5:
The skills framework and recruitment plan
A specific training pan for each IT profile
The identification of key employees
The managerial pyramid
The promotion of skills such as expertise, project management, management

6:
Advantage of outsource:
	Flexibility
	Access to competences not available internally
	It can be lower cost than internal
DisAdvantage of outsource:
	Loss of control
Ways of outsourcing
	Capacity sourcing (need resource)
	Fixed free contract (need team to build project)
	Third party application management (take out one activity ex infrastructure support)
-Outsourcing doesn't mean getting rid of responsibilities, itmeans taking time, following activity, investing management & project management
-Search best possible value of money and not the lowest possible cost
-Give thoughts to reversibility (one day outsource will insource)

Advantages of offshoring
	Decrease cost
	Reach new employement pools

7:
Smart Simplicity
-Understand and define the roles (what is happening on the field)
-Identification of dependencies (identify right cooperation mechanism)
-Design of regulation mechanism
	Improve understanding of what cowerkers do
	Reinforce the people who are integrators
	Expand the amount of power available
	Increase the need for reciprocity
	Make employee feel the shadow of the future (try to cope next level work)
	Put the blame on uncoperative 
-Design the Detailed mandates (Document the regulations)

8: Key take away
-It organization is not only structure, its also governance, process, KPI's, matrices, rule mandates
-Its about organizaing workforce
-Outsourcing/Off-source (manage peaks - off-peaks)
-Daily smooth work

1:
New efficient and better technology is coming and no CIO can stop it.

2:
Eve Meyer - Sociologist
If you want everything to stay the same, you need to change everything.
In sales department technology helps to improve prediction and inturns profit.
Experiment is necessory to see and browse the change.
CIO must know current standing point in perspective of balance sheet, asset, liabilities and should know where to go. It would helps to compare two states.
Technology changes needs how your organization works. Ex., if payment middleware is aboished by technology the front and back end will connet and operate diferently.
Transformation of an IT department is about changing its operating model.

3:
If you want to change IT department, then first you have to convince all stakeholders (corporate management,business colleagues,teams)
How to change:
	Build diagnosis which would be shared by all organization. (Where am I today?, Where could I be?, What could I do differently?, Benchmarks, competetiors etc)
	Based on diagnosis, build roadmap.
Transformation is way different from cost cutting
	
Transformation should be built around 3 dimensions:
	-Improve service to the users
	-Contribute to the success of business
	-Improve IT efficiency and does that bring savings

4: Choose the right levers of change
Changing implies changing twice, first mind then reality.
Five catagory of levers:
	Adjusting the level of service (how do I make sure to meet the user's expectation)
	Simplifying the organization (centralizing, shared service centers, offshore, pools of resources)
	Mutualization, consolidation and standardization (reduce complexity)
	Improvement process efficiency
	Sourcing optimization

5: Drive the transformations
Transformation should be process as project and it has three steps
Every project follow a pattern:
	-Preparation
		Present plan and get people ready for change,
	-Implementation
	-Perseverance
		You will have against you, other people who have something to loose, and you will have with you, very few people who have something to gain.
	-Transformation
Transformation should be process as project and it has three steps
	Diagnosis -> Design of roadmap -> Implementation
Diagnosis:
	-Where am I and where do I want to go
	-Transperancy
	-Weekly review
	-Monthly review with the business teams and executive committee
	-Diagnosis every 4 months

6: Key takeaways
IT organization needs to changed because technology is changing fast and you will certainly want to reap the benefit of technology
Diagnosis
Levers
Drive transformation as a project

CIO - I am here to help you not to judge you.
