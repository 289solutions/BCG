W3-> Steer the balancesheet
As the CIO of a global carmaker company, urgent and unplanned projects can arise. Give an example of such a project; give two suggestions to prepare you to such an unplanned project before it arises and two suggestions to lead the project to success (you can think both short and long term).
- Carefully explain the choice of the project and your arguments
- Max 450 words
#Project example:
In mid of year automobile company ZXC Inc realizes that they are losing customer sight and the organization needs to be widely visible to customers and increase car sales per year. ZXC Inc approaches CIO to build an application to identify the potential customers and on that base provide a data platform to sales executive for better marketing approach.

#Preparation of unplanned project before it arrives:
a). Prepare IT Balance sheet with granular level information of assets and liabilities and review the IT strategy periodically to aligned with  business goals. Streamline review would help to identify the projects in the pipeline along with their severity and timeline urgency. Accordingly budget could be transformed to accommodate any urgent project. 
b). Place the control and reporting mechanism in each branches of workflow to ensure transparency. It would provide the current state of IT with the internal & external staff plan (experience, skills, expertise etc.), supply and technology plans. Transparency in process would help to manage assets more efficiently.  

#Lead project to success:Given scenarios is example of long term project so business and IT agreed to implement project in phases of ‘n’ fiscal year. 
a). Module delivered in each year will have an impact on next year’s run costs. For first year only change cost will indulge for project and zero run cost. However the next year budget will have a run cost associated with the delivered modules in first year. Year after year run cost would go high because of inflation, so the ratio of run and change cost must be maintained over the time period. It could be achieved through optimizing sourcing strategies and monitoring volumes carefully. IT spending view by types of activity helps understand the actual use of budget and dynamics of the system. 
b). Beyond a short term action plan, launching a deep transformation of the IT department will reinforce its performance, both in terms of costs and ability to deliver project and support business line in their development. On top of savings, streamlining the process and organization, questioning the technical and sourcing strategies, and revisiting the IT landscape are opportunities to build more efficient teams with more flexibility to develop and support core business needs



 



W4->Market and sell products
As the newly appointed CIO of a national retail company, you order an internal survey and realize that IT is by far the less popular department of the company. Give three concrete action points that you would focus on to change the situation.
- Carefully explain your arguments
- Max 450 words
The survey result clearly shows dissonance business/customer with IT. To overcome these flaws, department must concentrate on below mentioned points.
1. IT department should define accurate and precise architecture of norms and standards. The architecture includes IT policy of applications, data strategy and infrastructure. IT policy of application shall include the software eligibility criteria, license requirement. Data strategy shall cover the storage and security of organization data. Finally infrastructure covers the requirement of server/system and service level provided to user.  These point scale must be decided in consensus with all stakeholders ahead of time around same table.  It would help to avoid inevitable scenarios by managing requirements effectively well in advance.
2. IT department should segment their users on basis of role criticality and their needs and be careful about providing services. Client satisfaction is the basic need to make department popular in the organization. It could be done through understanding the expectation and the perception of the clients. All expectation can not be fulfill so a tradeoff has to be made between IT preferences and associated price. The matrix of segments and tradeoffs will be master key to ensure service is working smoothly.
3. IT department should manage client’s expectation by creating well explained, simple and credible product and services catalogue. The catalogue must present a consistent product offer and describes all attributes and advantages of product and services. Department should also well communicate the business plan to manage trouble and build a continuous improvement culture on floor.
Conclusion:
Client’s satisfaction is function of perception and expectation. The expectation could be managed by creating catalogues and architecture considering the viewpoint of all stakeholders and perception would be managed through putting effort to smooth daily operation work.





 



W5->Run the factories
You are now the CIO of a global bank. Describe one activity that you would keep in-house, one activity that you would offshore and one that you would outsource and explain why.
Moreover, what would you define being the right level of centralization for the bank?
- Use notion from module 4
- Carefully explain your arguments
To make the decision on activity to be either in-house or outsourced must be taken considering the strategic plan of global bank.  The expectation must be clearly defined from internal and outsourced and make it as win-win situation for both parties, in this case its Bank and vendor company. Activities should be segregated for in-house/offshore/outsource to run the IT department efficiently by maximizing the value at minimum cost.
 1: In-house activity
The bench to generate right demand quality and manage project efficiently should be implemented within the organization. Both of these activities require business people to maintain the transparency between what is demanded and what is delivered.
Demand quality can be defined as number of requirements per generated value for bank. High demand quality can be achieved through building a process between business and IT to generate maximum value.
Managing project should also be in housed and ensure optimization of business requirements & quality, project delay and associated cost. These could be achieved by prioritizing the demanded functionalities, limiting the project size, setting tangible intermediate milestones and maintain the project status transparency by establishing formal reviews with the business quarterly.
 2: Offshore activity
Application development can offshored as it doesn’t require to be with business person when process are in place to give them direction about the clear requirement and timelines and keep taking updates on regular basis to manage project and maintain transparency with the business. It has been voted for outsource to increase the unit productivity.  Unit productivity is defined as number of resources per output multiplied by cost per resources.
3: Outsourced activity
Infrastructure can be outsourced. It costs around 50%-60% of the cost of total IT budget. In the environment of continuous changing IT requirements it’s more appropriate to consider the possibility of technology lock-in & scalability of organization data volume and ensure the continuous transformation of infrastructure to assure it’s more reliable and cost efficient. While outsourcing the infrastructure an expectation must be clearly set for SLA(service level agreement), aligned with infrastructure strategic plan with sustainable milestones and specific dates.
4: Right level of centralization
To align in-house, offshore and outsourced activities the process must be in place and all stakeholders must follow and respect the process to ensure good quality of service at low cost. The chain which links all three activities will lead to run them efficiently by maximizing the demand quality & unit productivity and minimizing the technical complexity. All of them collectively will guarantee the reliability and operations on daily basis with maximum quality of service. Sometime it also needs a proper tradeoff to ensure department efficiency.
