As the CIO of a global carmaker company, urgent and unplanned projects can arise. Give an example of such a project; give two suggestions to prepare you to such an unplanned project before it arises and two suggestions to lead the project to success (you can think both short and long term). 

- Carefully explain the choice of the project and your arguments
- Max 450 words

Neeraj Mishra:
Example:
In mid of year automobile company ZXC Inc realizes that they are losing customer sight and the organization needs to be widely visible to customers and increase car sales per year. ZXC Inc approaches CIO to build an application to identify the potential customers and on that base provide a data platform to sales executive for better marketing approach.
Preparation of unplanned project before it arrives:
a). Prepare IT Balance sheet with granular level information of assets and liabilities and review the IT strategy periodically to aligned with  business goals. Streamline review would help to identify the projects in the pipeline along with their severity and timeline urgency. Accordingly budget could be transformed to accommodate any urgent project. 
b). Place the control and reporting mechanism in each branches of workflow to ensure transparency. It would provide the current state of IT with the internal & external staff plan (experience, skills, expertise etc.), supply and technology plans. Transparency in process would help to manage assets more efficiently.  
Lead project to success:
Given scenarios is example of long term project so business and IT agreed to implement project in phases of ‘n’ fiscal year. 
a). Module delivered in each year will have an impact on next year’s run costs. For first year only change cost will indulge for project and zero run cost. However the next year budget will have a run cost associated with the delivered modules in first year. Year after year run cost would go high because of inflation, so the ratio of run and change cost must be maintained over the time period. It could be achieved through optimizing sourcing strategies and monitoring volumes carefully. IT spending view by types of activity helps understand the actual use of budget and dynamics of the system. 
b). Beyond a short term action plan, launching a deep transformation of the IT department will reinforce its performance, both in terms of costs and ability to deliver project and support business line in their development. On top of savings, streamlining the process and organization, questioning the technical and sourcing strategies, and revisiting the IT landscape are opportunities to build more efficient teams with more flexibility to develop and support core business needs.

Example of urgent and unplanned project: -
ABC & co. one of the largest automotive company, planned to redesign CRM system to directly interact with customers with the detail information about the new products, services and to understand the consensus of the customers on their product and services. Key strategy of the firm is to reach their current customers and acquire future customers at faster speed than competitors. Also to improve the product and service experience of customers.
In the middle of the implementation of this large project, marketing team come up with two new requirements.
Ø  They would like to embed poll questions on every page customers visited.
Ø  Build an analytical dashboard from the responses of poll questions.
These requirements were not mentioned earlier during planning phase, so it is identified as unplanned changes or unplanned project.
If we have close look at our strategic vision to redesign this system, we realize that these changes or the project is urgent to understand the consensus of current customers and future customers to build better product and service experience.
Suggestion to prepare for such unplanned project before it arises: -
1)    Invest time upfront to determine right project scope and make sure all stakeholders are crystal clear about what need to be developed. Culture of openness and transparency need to be created, stakeholders will be actively engaged. We require to keep an excess amount in periodic budget that estimated expenditure and also keep track of the overspending and underspending on different projects.
2)    To manage uncertainty IT budget need to be synchronized with global budget, and that required to be monitored periodically along with the proposed projects. We need to use activity based costing method to understand the run cost, change cost, mechanic inflation and prepare plan to manage them.
 
Suggestions to lead unplanned and urgent project to success: -
1)    We require to build a quantitative risk assessment model to understand the risk of the unplanned changes. According to the weighted average score of all categories we need to define implementation plan of that unplanned change.
(We need to define score against the value of each category in scale of 0-10).

Categories are as follows: -
•         Delay in the introduction of the change requirement.
•         Expected return from the change.
•         Risk involved in the incorrect implementation of the change.
•         Resource required to deliver the change.
•         Cost required to deliver the change.
•         Impact of the change to other changes.
Based on the final score of risk assessment we need to communicate with key stakeholders. We require to in line necessary budget and resources. After that we can start the development phase and promise to end up with successful implementation.

World Cars Inc (WCI): Project Decision to Acquire Overseas Cars Ltd (OCL).

Background  

On May 1, 2016 WCI acquired Overseas Cars Ltd a company operating in Spain.   Existing OCL car inventory will be sold off over the next 6 months, WCI imports will be substituted from an adjoining country until the factory in Spain is retooled and up and running in 2 year’s time with WCO tools.  The IT mandate is to develop systems to manage the new operations. 

Key Issues

Continuity of Business and Management of Information

To make the decision on activity to be either in-house or outsourced must be taken considering the strategic plan of global bank.  The expectation must be clearly defined from internal and outsourced and make it as win-win situation for both parties, in this case its Bank and vendor company. Activities should be segregated for in-house/offshore/outsource to run the IT department efficiently by maximizing the value at minimum cost.
 
1: In-house activity
The bench to generate right demand quality and manage project efficiently should be implemented within the organization. Both of these activities require business people to maintain the transparency between what is demanded and what is delivered.
Demand quality can be defined as number of requirements per generated value for bank. High demand quality can be achieved through building a process between business and IT to generate maximum value.
Managing project should also be in housed and ensure optimization of business requirements & quality, project delay and associated cost. These could be achieved by prioritizing the demanded functionalities, limiting the project size, setting tangible intermediate milestones and maintain the project status transparency by establishing formal reviews with the business quarterly.
 
2: Offshore activity
Application development can offshored as it doesn’t require to be with business person when process are in place to give them direction about the clear requirement and timelines and keep taking updates on regular basis to manage project and maintain transparency with the business. It has been voted for outsource to increase the unit productivity.  Unit productivity is defined as number of resources per output multiplied by cost per resources.
 
3: Outsourced activity
Infrastructure can be outsourced. It costs around 50%-60% of the cost of total IT budget. In the environment of continuous changing IT requirements it’s more appropriate to consider the possibility of technology lock-in & scalability of organization data volume and ensure the continuous transformation of infrastructure to assure it’s more reliable and cost efficient. While outsourcing the infrastructure an expectation must be clearly set for SLA(service level agreement), aligned with infrastructure strategic plan with sustainable milestones and specific dates.
 
4: Right level of centralization
To align in-house, offshore and outsourced activities the process must be in place and all stakeholders must follow and respect the process to ensure good quality of service at low cost. The chain which links all three activities will lead to run them efficiently by maximizing the demand quality & unit productivity and minimizing the technical complexity. All of them collectively will guarantee the reliability and operations on daily basis with maximum quality of service. Sometime it also needs a proper tradeoff to ensure department efficiency.



1.  Activity to Keep in House - Retail Banking Investments Advice

System Purpose - High level of customer service with differentiation from other banks on areas including

- Financial knowledge of customer such as wealth, salary, investment portfolio to be tracked/made available to investment staff
- History of services provided by the bank
- Credit scores
- Risk profile of customer
- Recommendations for investment management

As a personal service is offered at infrequent intervals that requires a personal service and high degree of trust this is a low volume differentiated product rather a high transactional standard product where lowest cost is important

2.  Activity to Offshore - International Settlements

System Purpose - High volume of transactions processed efficiently

- High volume undifferentiated offering that is not visible to the customer
- Key requirements are low cost per transaction; processing accuracy and timeliness; and data security/integrity.  Data communication between countries needs to be secure/encrypted.
- Language skills may be required if items are not processed accurately for follow up and to support users in different countries.  However, automated transaction tools are increasingly effective. 
- Such services which may require manual data input and validation and so lower cost locations and lower wage costs should be targeted along with any international tax savings from location in particular countries.   
- The political and economic stability of the host country would need to be assessed along with terrorism/climatic threats  
- Keeping this in house will preserve confidentiality

3.  Activity to Outsource - Branch Terminals/Hardware Infrastructure Support

System Purpose - High level of employee and customer service with undifferentiated back office architecture

- Required at each country level
- Each branch may lack sufficient scale to have a dedicated IT user support resource
- Computer terminals, networking gear etc.  is a commodity type hardware product 
- Response time is key to maintain service up time to customers and content employees
- There ought to be secure 3rd party providers on a country by country basis who support infrastructure to several financial institutions to gain critical mass to make their services affordable while maintaining integrity.

4.  Right Level of Centralization for the Bank

Information needs to be accessible where it is of use to make decisions and service customers while maintaining data privacy and efficient processing costs.  

Central systems should include corporate governance oversight for planning and control of performance of national subsidiaries and setting and enforcing of policies around best practices and authorization limits.  Critical will be the need to ensure compliance with transnational regulatory compliance such as Basel ratios for assets and lending; anti-money laundering and tax evasion.  So central systems need to support financial oversight and statutory and management reporting.  Policy can be enforced by international IT auditors working independent of the IT function. 

Data, applications and infrastructure

The continuing fall in IT systems costs and telecommunications supports a balance between local data processing of transactions and user support, while role up of information to agreed policy standards at a most cost effective manner.  This pushes information closest to where it is needed to make quick decisions and allows some flexibility at a local level to meet local market needs such as local laws and work practices.
