1:
The architecture to manage tension ahead of time
Manage the client's expectation
Product & Service Offer
The catalogue to overcome tension about products
Showcase even on small stuff
Auguste Detoeuf - Never complaint about a difficult client: He makes you progress. Treat others even better: They are the person why you make profits.

2: Manage tensions (inevitable scenarios of delay, breach etc)
-Involve all stakeholders ahead of time around same table
-Define an architecture (IT policy of application(s/w), data(security,storage),infrastructure(service level, types of material)

3: Manage client's expectation
-Segmentation
-Client's settisfaction = Perception - Expectation
-Expectation of 3 types:
	-Basic (things should work)
	-Waiting Time
	-Personalization (People don't want to be treated as number but as individual)
-Perception of 3 component
	-Product offering
	-Operation
	-Behavior
	
4: Product & Service Offer
-Product and service offer must be consistent with policy

5: The catalogue to overcome tension about products
Aim of Catalogue
-Present a consistent product offer
-Remind constraints and desadvantages
-Explain policies
Creating catalogue
-Tradeoff between IT preference and price

6: Showcase even on small stuff [how to manage trouble]
-Set the expectation by stating what service is being provided and how will it be improving.
-Continuous improvement culture

7: Key takeaways
- Define clear norms and standards
- Product and service offer must be well explained, simple and credible
- Make products cheap/costly which product you want people to use/don't use
- Very carefull about small stuff (providing service, managing expectation, ensure service is working smoothly)
