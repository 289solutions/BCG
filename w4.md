-3 factories of IT department
-what is an efficient factory
-Two Speed IT
-Project management
-Manage the infrastructure

2:-3 factories of IT department
Application odevelopment, 
Infrastructure (make sure good QOS at low cost), 
User support

3:-what is an efficient factory
Maximum value at minimal cost
Cost = f(demand quality, Unit productivity, technical complexity)
Demand quality: its about defining right process between business & IT.
Unit productivity: Right project methodology (manage resource cost)
Technical Complexity
Maximize IT performance = minimize cost / vc* = min[(Demand quality)^-1 * (Unit productivity)^-1 * (Technical complexity)]

Demand quality       = #Requirements/vc*
Unit productivity    = #Resources per Output * Cost per resource
Technical complexity = #output units / requirements
* -> value created

4:-Two Speed IT
Industrial speed: Predictability, long lead teams, functionally organized teams
Digital speed:  Unpredictability, speed, flexibility, collaboration
-Differentiate the requirements to be processed at either industrial speed or digital speed
-Create platform for architecture then put applications for global requirement adaption

5:-Project management
