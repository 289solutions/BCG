-Two Speed IT
-Project management
-Manage the infrastructure

2:-3 factories of IT department
Application odevelopment, 
Infrastructure (make sure good QOS at low cost), 
User support

3:-what is an efficient factory
Maximum value at minimal cost
Cost = f(demand quality, Unit productivity, technical complexity)
Demand quality: its about defining right process between business & IT.
Unit productivity: Right project methodology (manage resource cost)
Technical Complexity
Maximize IT performance = minimize cost / vc* = min[(Demand quality)^-1 * (Unit productivity)^-1 * (Technical complexity)]

Demand quality       = #Requirements/vc*
Unit productivity    = #Resources per Output * Cost per resource
Technical complexity = #output units / requirements
* -> value created

4:-Two Speed IT
Industrial speed: Predictability, long lead teams, functionally organized teams
Digital speed:  Unpredictability, speed, flexibility, collaboration
-Differentiate the requirements to be processed at either industrial speed or digital speed
-Create platform for architecture then put applications for global requirement adaption

5:-Project management
Optimize 3 things: Business requirements & quality, Delay, and cost
Key focus: Time
Must have and nice to have in requirements
Train model (train going in tunnel)
6 simple rules for project management:
-1-Limit the definition phase
-2-Finish each project in 12 months
-3-Limit project's size
-4-Set tangible intermidiate milestones
-5-Prioritize functionalities
-6-Establish formal reviews (where business people understand exactly the situation and dificulties of project. There must be transparancy in project)

technological aspect, Business aspect & leader aspect

6:-Manage the infrastructure
Infrastructure represents 50-60% of the cost of total IT budget.
-Consider technical constraints
-Risght skillset of employees
-Right process at right place and respect it

the role of CIOs
-Gurantee the reliability of operations on daily basis (incidents)
-Continuously transform infrastructure to make sure its more reliable and cost efficient
-Formalize a specific infrastructure strategic plan with standable milestones, specific dates.

Decision on outsource: 1:Rely on strategic plan(what you want to achieve); 2:Win-Win situation; 3:define outsourcing expectation and internal expectation
